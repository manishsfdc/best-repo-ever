# SFDC Lightning Tutorial

This repository consists of all the code used in the [Salesforce Lightning Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuL63vr-9xHyUBXPzHVvr08ayU5N06YoS).

## Getting Started

The whole code is divided into 6 branches. You can switch to different branches as you move through the tutorial one by one.
Description of each video is given in the respective blog post whose link is in the description of each video.
If you are getting started with lightning, you should read a simple blog on [Salesforce Lightning Basics](https://sfdcstop.blogspot.in/2018/01/salesforce-lightning-basics.html)
and then move further towards the tutorials.

### Prerequisites

There is no such software installation or prerequisites for getting started with Lightning. However experience with basic HTML, CSS will be a plus.
I have tried my best to explain each and every point in the code through videos, posts as well as in the comments too. 
You just need a salesforce org to code lightning components and see the result.
You can sign up for a developer org [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
You can clone this repository in your local system using the below command or directly download as zip file.

```
git clone https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning.git
```

### Running the Code

There are a total of 6 branches in this repository. As you follow the tutorial, you can switch to each branch in the following order :-

1. [read](https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning/tree/read)
2. [update](https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning/tree/update)
3. [delete](https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning/tree/delete)
4. [create](https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning/tree/create)
5. [validate](https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning/tree/validate)
6. [master](https://github.com/rahulmalhotra/SFDC-Lightning/tree/master)

You can switch to one branch to another using **git checkout** command.
For example, you can switch to read branch using the following command:- 

```
git checkout read
```

And then to master:-

```
git checkout master
```

## Tools and Softwares used

You can code and run in your salesforce org itself using the developer console provided by Salesforce.
However I like to use mavensmate to keep a local copy of code on my system too.
So below are the tools or softwares I use personally :-

* [Mavensmate](https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate-Desktop/releases) - Open Source IDE for Salesforce
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Text Editor (with mavensmate plugin)
